    <h1>Scene WorryWart</h1>
    <p>

        Aadia took notice of Joy’s change in mood of the past few days. She noticed that Joy would stop doing his chores and that he's just getting slower at doing the things he usually does. Out of her own genuine worry for her little brother, she made sure to ask him how he was feeling one day. Joy was shocked. Joy would immediately respond to Aadia and tell her he is actually fine. Joy wouldn’t reveal what he really feels to Aadia. He didn’t want to hurt her, rather he didn’t want Aadia to worry about him, because he believes his issue is not that big at all. That she would only be wasting her energy with him. He knows that Aadia cares deeply, and would take her extremely seriously. She usually provides great feedback, and she helps Joy out a lot on friend issues or homework, so is Joy willing to take the shot of asking her?
