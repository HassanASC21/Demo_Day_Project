    <h1>Scene: opening up</h1>
    <p>After the event with Gregory Joy really didn’t know how to describe how he was feeling. After talking with his parents about how he’s feeling his parents said the same thing as Gregory. He started wondering whether what Gregory said was right. He was trying to explain to his parents that he is feeling tired and down all the time. His parents couldn’t understand though. His parents said of course you feel tired, you keep yourself busy. In fact they lectured Joy on his grades. They said that he wasn’t keeping himself busy enough, and that his sadness is just a feeling that will go away, just get better grades and he will feel absolutely better. It was at that moment where he noticed that it wasn’t any good talking to his parents about his feelings, since they never really understood. His parents are basically working machines to him and they couldn’t possibly understand what he is going through, so it felt futile to talk with them. Then the following weeks come after and it’s your birthday. Your really good friend Summer insists on giving you a gift for your birthday.  Joy is deeply touched by his effort and it really makes you happy, and makes Joy feel less lonely in the world. Do you accept it?
