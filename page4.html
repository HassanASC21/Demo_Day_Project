    <h1>Scene: Confrontation</h1>
<p>going to school after his interaction with Aadia he felt really bad. He knew that Aadia was not ill intended in her words or what she said. What she said was genuine advice and Joy didn’t want to listen to Aadia explain that he is being sad. He is supposed to be a busy person that will do amazing things. Joy felt like the worst brother at that moment and that he just caused Aadia more trouble. He then went to school and talked with some of his friends. In the midst of joking around his friend Gregory and joked about Joy being sad all the time. He was telling Joy that he can just brighten up, as easy as opening a lamp, turning it off, and turning it on. According to Gregory It’s basically Joy’s choice at the end whether Joy wants to keep the lamp open, and when Joy does decide to turn the lamp off, Joy decides to be sad. Joy felt that it was even more difficult to explain his sadness. This sadness would occur to him every day and that it wouldn’t stop coming to him. Why is it that he is feeling tired all of a sudden, and that he is always feeling under the weather. Everytime he put it logically together it just didn’t make sense. He then contemplates whether or not to try to word out how he feels about the situation.
