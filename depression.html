<h1>Depression</h1>
    <p>Contextualization:

        The player will be playing as a character named Joy. Joy is a little brother, and has a caring older sister named Aaida. He also has both his parents but his parents are usually very busy with work so it’s hard to spend time with them on Joy's part. Joy’s parents are very busy people and have the busy mentality and believe success is attained after keeping yourself busy. Because they think that Joy’s parents urge their children to do well in school. The family lives in New York City, a very condensed area of people of different kinds. Joy also happens to live in an Apartment with his whole family so he doesn’t have much space to himself to do his own things, and he is very limited on the things he can and wants to do. Currently Joy is in his Junior year of Highschool , but recently he has noticed feelings of sadness dawn on him every day. He feels distant from everyone and will feel lonier the more he thinks about his sadness. Not only is he starting to realize he is feeling sad, but he is also missing a bunch of his homeworks in school. He is starting to feel greatly overwhelmed by school.
