    <h1>Scene 1: Waking up</h1>
<p>

    Joy is a very busy person and so he has a tight sleep schedule. He gets a roughly safe and healthy amount of sleep everyday. Recently however, he has noticed that it is harder to get up from bed. It’s not that the bed is the most comfortable thing in the world to lay on, rather it feels like his body is weighed down by the heaviest weights in the world. His body feels so heavy and feels so unmotivated. Joy just really doesn’t want to get up and he just wants to sleep more. He wants his feelings of tiredness to go. How else will it go??
    
    he is to make on his sleeping habits, Joy still feels tired everyday. Joy is noticeably tired when people will start asking him how he feels. Joy would default his answer to, “oh no worries, I’m just a little tired.”Joy would also lose motivation as well, as the tasks he’s been doing on an everyday basis seem impossible to do for him now. His homework feels impossible, and the chores he usually does, also feel unbearable.
