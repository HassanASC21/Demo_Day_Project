    <h1>Joy had depression</h1>
    <p>Joy will have finally talked to a doctor about his situation. They have discussed Joy’s issues with his life. His experiences and what has been going on. The indescribable moments have been discussed. The doctor will have finally diagnosed Joy with depression. At that point Joy didn’t know how to react. What does that mean, is he going to be sad forever? The doctor explained to him what was going on. Joy starts freaking out, he doesn’t know how to bring it up to his parents or anything. The doctor assured him that he will be fine. The doctor further tells him that he has taken his first big step already. Joy then looks at the doctor in confusion. The doctor then said, “yes your first big step was asking for help! This step may seem like a small one to others, however for you in this case, it's an extremely huge step!” Joy looks at his bracelet and stares at it. He smiles at the bracelet and then holds it tight to himself. Joy then sheds a tear of relief that he can finally move, although his days are still yet to come, he can still move and ask for help. He is assured that he can ask for guidance and that maybe one day he can live up to his name.
